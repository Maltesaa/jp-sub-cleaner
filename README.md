# jp-sub-cleaner
Replaces half width katakana to full width and removes some unnecessary characters. I made this because I did not find any other way to convert half width katakana to full width easily and in bulk. I'm not a programmer and used ChatGPT for a lot of the code so it's probably not super optimal.

# How to use:
1. Install Python
2. Place all .srt subtitle files you want to convert in a folder together with sub-cleaner.py
3. Run sub-cleaner.py
