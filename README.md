# jp-sub-cleaner
Replaces half width katakana to full width and removes some unnecessary characters.

How to use:
1. Install Python
2. Place all .srt subtitle files you want to convert in a folder together with sub-cleaner.py
3. Run sub-cleaner.py

Shoutout to chatgpt for writing 99% of the code!

I made this because I did not find any other way to bulk convert half width katakana to full width easily and in bulk. I am aware that this code is bad, but it works.
